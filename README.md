#### How to use the API

- Import the getHoroscope(String sunsign) from the src/index.js
- The method takes as a parameter the sunsign as a string _eg. Leo, Libra, Cancer, Taurus, etc._
- The method returns an object with three attributes. An example: `{date: "2019-05-24", horoscope: "Jimmy is the prince of concordia", sunsign: "Leo"}`
- With that, good luck with the front-end.
